# Contributing to Engram

Thanks for contributing. Engram enforces a strict **issue-first workflow** — every change starts with an approved issue.

---

## Contribution Workflow

```
Open Issue → Get status:approved → Open PR → Add type:* label → Review & Merge
```

### Step 1: Open an Issue

Use the correct template:
- **Bug Report** — for bugs
- **Feature Request** — for new features or improvements

> ⚠️ Blank issues are disabled. You must use a template.

Fill in all required fields. Your issue will automatically receive the `status:needs-review` label.

### Step 2: Wait for Approval

A maintainer will review the issue and add the `status:approved` label if it's accepted for implementation.

**Do not open a PR until the issue is approved.** Automated checks will block PRs that reference unapproved issues.

### Step 3: Open a Pull Request

Once the issue is approved:

1. Fork the repo and create a branch from `main`
2. Implement your change
3. Open a PR using the PR template — **link the approved issue** with `Closes #N`
4. Add exactly **one `type:*` label** to the PR (see label system below)

### Step 4: Automated PR Checks

Five checks run automatically on every PR:

#### PR Validation

| Check | What it verifies |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Check Issue Reference** | PR body contains `Closes #N`, `Fixes #N`, or `Resolves #N` |
| **Check Issue Has status:approved** | The linked issue has the `status:approved` label |
| **Check PR Has type:* Label** | PR has exactly one `type:*` label |

#### CI Tests

| Check | What it runs |
|-------|-------------|
| **Unit Tests** | `go test ./...` — all tests except those tagged with `//go:build e2e` |
| **E2E Tests** | `go test -tags e2e ./internal/server/...` — end-to-end integration tests |

All five checks must pass before a PR can be merged.

> **Repo admin note:** Set these as required status checks in branch protection rules for `main`: `Unit Tests`, `E2E Tests`, and `PR Validation`.

## Label System

### Type Labels (required on every PR — pick exactly one)

| Label | Color | Use for |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `type:bug` | 🔴 | Bug fixes |
| `type:feature` | 🔵 | New features |
| `type:docs` | 🔵 | Documentation-only changes |
| `type:refactor` | 🟣 | Code refactoring with no behavior change |
| `type:chore` | ⚪ | Maintenance, tooling, dependencies |
| `type:breaking-change` | 🔴 | Breaking changes (requires major version bump) |

### Status Labels (set by maintainers)

| Label | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `status:needs-review` | Awaiting maintainer review (auto-applied to new issues) |
| `status:approved` | Approved for implementation — PRs can now be opened |

### Priority Labels (set by maintainers)

`priority:high`, `priority:medium`, `priority:low`

## PR Rules

- Keep PR scope focused — one logical change per PR
- Use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format
- Ensure all tests pass locally before pushing:
  - Unit: `go test ./...`
  - E2E: `go test -tags e2e ./internal/server/...`
- Update docs in the same PR when behavior changes
- Do not reference endpoints/scripts that do not exist in code
- Do not include `Co-Authored-By` trailers in commits

### Conventional Commit Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <short description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Examples:**

```
feat(cli): add --json flag to session list command

fix(store): prevent duplicate observation insert on retry

docs(contributing): add label system documentation

refactor(internal): extract search query sanitizer

chore(deps): bump github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea to v0.26

fix!: change session ID format (breaking change)
BREAKING CHANGE: session IDs are now UUIDs instead of integers
```

Types map to labels: `feat` → `type:feature`, `fix` → `type:bug`, `docs` → `type:docs`, `refactor` → `type:refactor`, `chore` → `type:chore`.

## Skill Authoring Standard

Repository skills live in `skills/`.

Use a **hybrid format**:

1. Structured base (purpose, when to use, critical rules, checklists)
2. Cookbook section (`If / Then / Example`) for repetitive actions

Why hybrid:
- Structured base protects correctness and architecture intent
- Cookbook improves execution consistency for common flows

---

## Agent Skill Linking

Run:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

This links repo `skills/*` into project-local:
- `.claude/skills/*`
- `.codex/skills/*`
- `.gemini/skills/*`
